# strategic-planning-template
A markdown-based template for better strategic planning outcomes.

## About
This template is a variation of one that I frequently use to plan complex, cross-functional initiatives at GitHub.  It can provide a useful "North Star" for teams or individuals who need to describe and socialize a large body of strategic work.

This template is referenced in my [2023 Black Hat USA talk](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/index.html#i-was-tasked-with-enrolling-millions-of-developers-in-fa---heres-what-happened-32925).  This template is licensed with [The Unlicense](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) and may be used in any setting without restriction.
